# BoundingBox Extractor

This directory contains two tightly-integrated components:

* a C++ tool called `extract-bbs` that takes as an input the path to an image generated by the `md-renderer`, looks for bounding boxes for text sections, titles, code or lists and outputs data about the kind and location of each bounding box to a CSV file;
* a shell script called `main.sh` that, given a path to a directory, runs that C++ tool (when compiled as `extract-bbs` on Linux/Unix) with the path to each PNG in the directory.

## CSV Format

The generated CSV files have five columns: `Type`, `Start X`, `Start Y`, `End X`, `End Y`. The last four are self-explanatory: they are the coordinates of the bounding box. `Type` is one of the following:

* `1` if the bounding box is for a `paragraph`: a regular text section
* `2` if the bounding box is for a `title`
* `3` if the bounding box is for a `code` section
* `4` if the bounding box is for an unordered list
* `5` if the bounding box is for an ordered list
